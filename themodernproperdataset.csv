Remove the dough from the food processor and place on a lightly floured surface. Using your hands, mix the chives and green onions into the dough until just combined and the dough is a little less sticky.Using your hands press the dough into a rectangle, about 1-inch thick. Fold the rectangle into thirds and press into a 1-inch thick rectangle. Repeat folding and pressing 3 more times. Using a 2½- inch biscuit cutter, cut out 8 dough rounds or use a sharp knife to cut 9 dough squares. Gather any dough scraps and pat into a 1-inch-thick dough round. (You should have 9 rounds or squares.) Arrange biscuits on the prepared sheet pan and brush with buttermilk. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown.

When adding the butter you’ll want to pinch the mixture until you get the same pea-size crumbles or use a pastry cutter to cut in the butter. Just remember that your hands are much warmer than a food processor so keep an eye out that your butter doesn't soften too much ! You don’t want to overwork the dough."

10fresh basil leaves
⅓ cuppacked fresh cilantro leaves
4green onions, roughly chopped
6garlic cloves
¾ cupmayonnaise
2 tablespoonsfresh lemon juice (from 2 lemons)
","In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the salt. Pat chicken dry using a paper towel. Rub the chicken with spice mixture, completely coating its skin. Heat the grill over medium-high heat, 350-400°F (see Note 2) Once the grill is hot, brush the grates with the olive oil. Grill the chicken, skin-side down, over direct heat, until crispy and lightly charred, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, 250-300°F, then flip the chicken and continue grilling until the skin is golden brown, the juices run clear, and the internal temperature of the thickest part of the chicken reaches 165°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, in the base of a blender or food processor, combine the basil, cilantro, green onions, garlic, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and the remaining ½ teaspoon of the salt. Blend on high until smooth, about 3 minutes.Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Carve and serve family-style with the green garlic sauce on the side. Notes:How to Spatchcock Chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Place on a large cutting board, breast side down with the neck facing toward you. Using good-quality kitchen shears, hold the neck and cut along one side of the spine, separating it from the ribs. Be sure to cut as close to the spine as possible. Repeat on the other side of the spine. If you are having difficulty, rotate the bird so the tail faces you and cut from the other side. Flip the chicken breast-side up. Using the palms of your hands, press along the breastbone; you might hear a crack. This should flatten the chicken completely.If using a charcoal grill, move chicken away from direct heat while cooking to be sure you don’t dry it out. This method may take longer than 45 minutes, so be sure to use a thermometer for doneness."

Peel the skin off of the peaches and slice them into ¾-inch wedges. Transfer the slices to a second large bowl. Add the granulated sugar and toss to combine. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Strain the peaches over a medium skillet, letting all the peach juice drain into the pan, then return the peaches to the bowl. Heat the skillet over medium heat. Add in the vanilla, lemon juice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt and stir to combine. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the peach juice mixture and whisk to combine. Continue whisking until the sauce has thickened to a paste-like consistency, 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from heat, then add the peach slices and, using a rubber spatula, gently fold to combine. Let cool in the pan. Preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the center position.Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll the dough into two 14-inch rounds (about ¼ inch thick). Gently press one dough round to a 9-inch pie plate without stretching it. Trim the edges if necessary. Add the cooled peach mixture on top of the dough and gently spread into an even layer. Lay the second dough round over the filling and crimp the edges of the two dough rounds together with a fork or your fingers to seal. Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the Demerara sugar, if using. Using a sharp knife make two, 3-inch slits in the top of the crust in an X shape. Place the pie plate on a baking sheet and bake on the center rack for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and continue to bake until the crust is a deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about another 70 minutes. (If the crust is browning too quickly, tent the pie with foil halfway through baking.)Let the pie cool completely, about 2 hours, before cutting. Serve with ice cream or whipped cream. Note: The best way to pit a whole peach is with CLEAN needle nose pliers. With the pliers open to about the width of the pit, pierce the peach through the dimpled top and grab onto the pit tightly, then pull it out. "

1 batch","Heat oven to 300° F.In a small bowl mix together the salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, chili powder, paprika and cayenne until combined. If the ribs still have the thin clear membrane covering the back of the rack, you will need to remove it. Using a paring knife, start at one end of the ribs and carefully slide it under the membrane, until you have separated enough of the membrane to hold onto. Use a paper towel to hold your grip on the membrane. Using a spoon or paring knife, slowly pull back on the membrane until it separates from the rack. Rub the seasoning all over the ribs on both sides. Place the ribs, meat-side up, onto a rimmed baking sheet. If necessary, trim a few ribs off the rack and arrange them all to fit on the baking sheet. Cover the baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until very tender, about 2 1/2-3 hours. The meat should be practically falling off the bone. While the ribs are in the oven, make the barbecue sauce. Remove the ribs from the oven. Remove the foil and generously brush both sides of the cooked ribs with barbecue sauce. Arrange a rack in the upper ⅓ of the oven. Turn the broiler to high. Broil the ribs for 2-4 minutes, just until the barbecue sauce begins to caramelize. Watch them carefully, so that they don’t burn. Remove from the oven, lay the foil over the ribs and let them rest for 10 minutes before digging in! "

16 (22 cm)spring roll wrappers
10butter lettuce or romaine, leaves separated, halved
2English or Persian cucumbers, cut into matchsticks (see note 5)
3 cupsfresh herbs such as cilantro, mint, basil, or green onions, chopped
","1. Make the peanut sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar and hot water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add the peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, chili garlic sauce, and ground ginger. Whisk vigorously until the sauce comes together, about 1 minute. Add more hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until smooth. Taste and add salt as needed. Sprinkle the crushed peanuts on top of the sauce, if desired. 2. Make the sweet chili sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the sugar and hot water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Add the garlic, if desired, along with the fish sauce, lime juice, chili garlic sauce, and sesame oil. Stir to combine. 3. Make the spring rolls: Bring 2 large pots of water to a boil over high heat. Fill a large bowl with ice. To one pot, add the noodles and cook according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cool water. 4. Meanwhile, to the other pot of boiling water, add the shrimp. Cook until just pink, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to the ice bath and let them sit for about 5 minutes. Discard the shells and tails, then slice each shrimp crosswise, as if you were butterflying them. 5. Fill a shallow bowl or pie dish with warm water. Working with one spring roll wrapper at a time, dip the wrapper into the water and let soften, 8 to 10 seconds (see note 6 for more details). Lay the softened wrapper on top of a damp surface, like a cutting board. Place half a piece of lettuce at the edge of the wrapper closest to your body. Layer on a small handful of noodles, carrot, and cucumber. Place some herbs on the wrapper slightly above that pile, and then 3 or 4 shrimp halves slightly above the herbs. 6. Beginning from the edge closest to you, roll the wrapper away from your body. Once you reach the shrimp, fold in the sides, then keep rolling. Repeat with the remaining rice wrappers and filling, rewetting your work surface as needed. 7. Halve the spring rolls diagonally and arrange on a platter. Serve with dipping sauces alongside. **These rolls are best when eaten the day you make them, but they will store in the fridge for 1-2 days. We recommend wrapping each spring roll individually in plastic wrap before placing them in the fridge to keep them as fresh as possible. Note 1: The amount of brown sugar you choose to use will depend on how much sugar is in the peanut butter that you're using If you are using a sugar-free peanut butter, you will want to use the full 2 teaspoons, but if you're using a brand that has added sugar, you should start out with less or no sugar and add it just to taste (you may not even want to add any at all). Note 2: Likewise, the amount of salt you use in the peanut sauce will depend on how salty your peanut butter and soy sauce are. If you are using a salt-free peanut butter, or low sodium soy sauce, you may want to add a little salt to your peanut sauce. Taste it as you make it, and add salt if needed.Note 3: Rice noodles vary in size. Make sure you get the vermicelli (thin clear, or similar) ones. You may want to break or cut them in half or thirds before cooking to make them easier to handle once they are cooked. Note 4: Purchase large shrimp, not any labeled jumbo or colossal. You will be making 16 rolls and will need between 1 1/2 to 2 shrimp per roll depending on size. You can also purchase the shrimp precooked and skip this whole step. Note 5: You can use any cucumber that you want, but if you don't use an English or Persian cucumber, you'll likely want to remove any large seeds.Note 6: Do not soak the spring roll wrappers for too long—10 seconds really is the max—because the rice wrappers tend to break when they get too soft. Make sure that the surface you are working on is slightly damp so that the rice papers don’t stick, and rewet the surface as you go. "

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the guanciale to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving the rendered fat in the skillet.Add 1 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water to the pan, and bring the rendered fat and water to a simmer over medium heat. Add the pasta and cook, stirring constantly, until the water is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. While whisking, slowly pour ¼ cup of the reserved pasta water into the egg yolk-and-cheese mixture. While stirring, pour the egg yolk mixture into the pasta. Continue stirring until a creamy sauce forms, about 3 minutes. If needed, thin the sauce by adding additional pasta cooking water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add the guanciale and toss to combine. Serve topped with additional Parmesan and pepper. Note: We recommend not using pre-shredded Parmesan cheese. Freshly grated Parmesan cheese will melt into the sauce the best and create a creamy texture. "

Transfer the milk to a jar with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate. Will keep for up to 4 days. Shake well before drinking because the cinnamon will sink to the bottom and the milk tends to separate."

2 Tbspprotein powder, (vanilla or unflavored), optional
1 Tbspmelted coconut oil**
1/4 cupgranola
Fresh (not frozen) Strawberry slices
Fresh (not frozen) Banana slices
","Add the frozen strawberries and bananas to a blender (using a high-power gives the best results) and blend on low until they have created a coarse, somewhat sandy mixture. Add the milk, nut butter, and protein powder (if using) and blend on low, scraping down the sides as needed, until the mixture comes together in a thick “soft serve” consistency.Scoop the smoothie into a bowl and drizzle with the melted coconut oil. Allow the coconut oil to harden for 1 minute (you can place it in the freezer to speed up this process). Sprinkle with granola and hemp seeds and garnish with fresh fruit.Note: You will want to prepare for this smoothie bowl by letting bananas get overly ripe on your counter. Slice them into 1-inch pieces and freeze them. That way you always have frozen bananas on hand for this recipe. **Similar to chocolate magic shell, when you drizzle melted coconut oil over a cold smoothie bowl, it hardens. This adds a wonderfully pleasing texture and melt-in-your-mouth “crunch” to the smoothie bowl. "

","If your potatoes are extra large, cut them in half horizontally. Keeping the peel on, place them into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a heavy simmer/low boil and cook for 10-12 minutes. Drain the potatoes and place them back into the pot (off the heat) until they are cool enough to peel. You can do this the night before, but they are easier to peel when they are warm. Cook your bacon (if using) at this time.Preheat the oven to 400°. Butter or spray a 9x13 baking dish with cooking spray, set aside. Using the large holes of a cheese grater set over a large bowl, or the grating blade of a food processor, grate the now peeled, partially cooked potatoes. Grate the onion onto a thin kitchen towel. Over the sink wring and squeeze out as much liquid from the onion as possible. Add the shredded onion to the shredded potatoes in the large bowl and toss until combined. Add the cooked bacon or ham, if using, along with the gruyere, 1/4 cup parmesan, butter, salt, pepper, nutmeg, Greek yogurt and Dijon mustard to the potato mixture. Toss until fully combined. Spread the potato mixture evenly into the prepared baking dish. Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes. Turn the broiler on to high and broil about 3 minutes until lightly browned. While the potatoes are baking, bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over high heat (can use the same pot you boiled the potatoes in, just add less water this time). Add the asparagus to the boiling water and blanch until tender but still has a bite, about 3 minutes, drain and set aside. Remove the potatoes from the oven and turn the heat back to 400°F. Using the back of a spoon, make 8 indentations in the top of the casserole (like 8 deep wells) nestle the asparagus into the casserole around the wells. Crack 1 egg into each hole. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Return the dish to the oven. Bake at 400° for 9-10 minutes or until egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Keep a close eye on them, this may take a minute or two longer depending on your oven, but they can over cook quickly. Cut into 8 pieces. Garnish with chives, sour cream or yogurt, if desired. Serve immediately."

","Prepare the chicken breasts: Take a sharp knife and slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to create four even, thin cutlets. Place the cutlets between layers of plastic wrap or parchment paper and use a meat mallet to pound the cutlets until they're about 1/4 inch thick. This helps ensure tenderness and even cooking. Season the prepared chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Dredge them in the flour, shaking off any excess.Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of olive oil. When the butter begins to bubble, place the floured chicken breasts in the pan, taking care not to overcrowd the pan. Cook the chicken breasts until they are golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes total. Note: you may need to work in batches. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the pan along with the shallot and mushrooms.

","Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Pour in the sugar and use an immersion blender to blend the eggs and sugar for about 1 min, until well combined and sugar is mostly dissolved. You may need to hold the bowl at an angle for this step for best results, depending on the depth of your mixing bowl. Alternatively, you can do this whole process in a blender (see note) instead of a mixing bowl and immersion blender. With the immersion blender (or blender) running, slowly pour in the heavy cream and blend for 2-3 minutes, until a frothy layer has formed.Pour in the milk, bourbon, aged rum and nutmeg. Blend again for about a minute or two until the eggnog is frothy and well mixed.Pour the eggnog into a large, sealable container and store it in the fridge until it gets chilled through—overnight is best, but give it at least an hour. The eggnog will separate as it chills so before serving, use a rubber spatula to fold in the frothy top until it’s well mixed. Serve topped with a generous dusting of freshly grated nutmeg.Note: Eggnog will keep well in the fridge for up to one week. Note: if you choose to make this in a blender and you have a high-powered blender (such as a Vitamix) cut the blending times down by half, as high-powered blenders can sometimes introduce heat as they blend and we don't want that here. We like the immersion blender because it's easy to clean and isn't overly powerful. "

2 cupsshredded cheese of your choice, mozzarella or dairy-free
Fresh flat leaf parsley or basil, chopped, optional
","Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place a rack in the center of the oven.Prepare the bell peppers:Trim about 1/2-inch off the top and 1/2 inch off the bottom of each bell pepper. Set the bell pepper tops and bottoms aside for now—you'll need them to make the beef-and-sausage stuffed pepper filling later. Scrape out any seeds or white pith from each bell pepper “tube”. Now slice each bell pepper tube in half to make 8 “rings”, about 2-inches high, that are ready to be filled! Nestle the prepped bell pepper rings into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Make the stuffed pepper filling: Finely chop the tops and bottoms of the bell peppers that you trimmed off in the first step, discarding the stem. Warm the olive oil in a medium skillet set over medium-high heat. When the oil is glistening, add the finely chopped bell pepper pieces and onion and cook until tender, about 4-5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool while you season the meat.In a large bowl or stand mixer, combine the eggs, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Whisk until combined. Add the ground beef, Italian sausage, breadcrumbs, the cooled bell pepper-onion mixture and 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to the bowl. Mix with the paddle attachment in a stand mixer or your hands just until the ingredients are incorporated. Take care not to overmix, as that can make the filling overly dense or tough. Divide the stuffed pepper filling evenly between the bell pepper rings, pressing the “meatball” into the center of the bell pepper. Place in the oven to bake for 15 minutes. Then, top the stuffed bell peppers with the remaining cheese and bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the internal temperature of the meatballs reaches 165°F on an instant-read thermometer and the cheese is bubbly and melted. Sprinkle with fresh parsley or basil if desired."

","Make the seasoned rice: Using a fine mesh sieve/strainer, rinse the rice. ** Pour the water, vinegar, sesame oil and salt into a small saucepan (with a fitted lid) set over medium-high heat. Stir to combine. Bring the liquid to a boil. Add the rinsed rice, stir to combine evenly with the liquid and return to a boil before securing it with a tight fitting lid and reducing the heat to low. Simmer the rice for 18 minutes. Remove the lid, fluff up the rice to make sure all the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the heat and let it sit on the hot stove for 2-3 minutes longer after fluffing it again. Alternatively, add all ingredients to a rice cooker and cook. Make the Poke: Meanwhile in a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, green onions, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, rice vinegar and ginger juice from jar of pickled ginger. Add the tuna and salmon, toss to coat. Set aside.Make the cucumber salad: In a small bowl, toss everything together.When the rice is done cooking, fluff it up and let it cool for 20 minutes.Make the wasabi citrus sauce by mixing everything together in a small bowl.To assemble, divide the rice between 4 bowls, top with the salmon and tuna poke, cucumber salad and any of the desired toppings. Drizzle the bowls with the wasabi citrus sauce.**Don’t skip this quick, easy step—rinsing the rice before you cook it washes away some of the starch that’s on the surface of the rice, which is a good thing in this case. It’ll help ensure that your rice is nice and fluffy, instead of mushy or gummy."

","Place a steamer basket into a large pot filled with 2 inches of water. Place the cauliflower florets into the steaming basket. Heat the water until simmering over high heat. Reduce heat to low and steam the cauliflower until very tender. To test, pinch the cauliflower with cooking tongs, when it mushes, it is ready. About 20 minutes.Dump the cauliflower onto a kitchen towel and let cool for about 15 minutes. Gather the edges of the kitchen towel around the cauliflower and squeeze the water from the cauliflower. Try to get most of the water out, by giving it a good squeeze.Add 1 cup of flour and salt to the bowl of a food processor along with the cooked cauliflower. Pulse until combined. Dump the (sticky) dough onto a floured surface. resist the urge to add more flour to the dough. More flour will make your gnocchi chewy. With floured hands form the dough into a ball and cut into 8 equal parts. One at a time, shape or “roll” (this dough is VERY loose and is hard to roll) each dough chunk into a ½-inch-thick rope and set aside.Trim each dough rope into 1-inch pieces. You can cook the gnocchi in this shape/form, or gently press them each against the prongs of a fork and roll as you press to make cute little gnocchi like lines on them.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the gnocchi (this will reduce the boil). Bring the water back up to a boil cook for 3 minutes. The gnocchi will have all floated to the top. Strain using a colander. Enjoy with your favorite pasta sauce.Sautéed Gnocchi: If you like your gnocchi a little crispy (as shown in photos), you can also sauté them. Without having boiled them, heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and spray liberally with cooking spray. Homemade cauliflower gnocchi tends to stick to the pan. If you don’t have cooking spray add 2 tablespoons olive oil to the pan. Add the gnocchi in a single layer. This may need to be done in two batches. Cook until golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes total. Taste for tenderness. If the gnocchi is not cooked through, add water (1/4 cup at a time) to the pan and finish them off by steaming them by covering the skillet with a tight fitting lid."

Transfer the chicken pieces to the plate with the vegetables and eggs.Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil to the pan. Add the rice to the pan and spread it out into a thin, even layer. Let the rice cook, undisturbed for 1 minute at a time before tossing it and then frying it for another minute.

","MAKE THE PREFERMENT:Grab your bubbly starter, and add the lukewarm water. Mix them together thoroughly. Next, add the flour, and mix it in for about another minute or two. It will be very shaggy. Cover the dough with plastic wrap sit at room temperature for about 12 hours. MAKE THE DOUGH: Grab your bubbly pre-ferment, and add the lukewarm water. Use your hands to mix them together thoroughly. Next, add the all-purpose flour, and mix it in for about another minute or two. The dough will be very shaggy and may stick to your hands a lot. Use a bench scraper or silicone spatula to scrape off all dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a tea towel and let it sit for an hour. This rest period is called the autolyse. After an hour, sprinkle the salt over the dough. Use wet hands to grab and pinch the dough until the salt is mostly mixed in. THE FOLD-AND-STRETCH:Now we begin folding. Wet hands to keep the dough from sticking to your fingers and palms. Reach down the side of the bowl and grab a corner of the dough. Pull it up and push it down on top of the dough. Rotate the bowl a bit and do it again. Repeat this stretch-fold-rotate process 15-20 times, then cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes. NOTE: Be careful not to stretch the dough too far. You’re building strength here, and want to avoid tearing the dough. Every 30 minutes, for about three hours, you’ll repeat this stretch-and-fold process, until you’ve done it 6 times. With each stretch and fold your dough will get easier to handle. As your dough gets stronger, be more and more careful with your stretching. You’ll notice your dough will begin to rise a little throughout this process. That’s a good thing. Once you’ve finished your final fold-and-stretch, cover the dough and let it sit for 30-45 minutes. SHAPING THE DOUGH:Now, it’s time to pre-shape your sourdough loaf. Turn the dough out onto a a lightly-floured surface gently so as to avoid losing any air bubbles. NOTE: If you’re making more than one loaf, divide the dough accordingly. Use a scale to make sure all your loaves are the same size. Cover your hands with flour, to avoid sticking. Carefully pull the corners into the center of the dough, create a loose circle. Using a bench scraper, flip the dough over so the seam is down and allow it to rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare your proofing basket by dusting it with a generous amount of rice flour or all-purpose flour or a combination of both. If you don’t have a proofing basket, lay a tea towel flat and sprinkle it with flour. Use your hands to spread the flour into the entire surface of the towel and transfer it to a colander or medium-sized mixing bowl. After 30 minutes, dust the top of your loaf with flour. Flip it over with a bench scraper so that the floured side is against your work surface and the sticky side is up. Grab the edge of the dough at the bottom, pull it gently up allowing gravity to stretch it a bit, then fold it over onto the center of the dough, pressing it down stick to the center of the dough. Repeat with the right and left side of the dough. Lastly, grab the edge of the top of the dough and press it into the center and carefully roll the dough over so the seam is now down and the smooth side is up. If it's not quite a round, cup your palms around the dough and rotate it against the counter to shape it into a round loaf. This next step is best shown visually—you can watch a video of it in our IG story highlights! Rotate the dough around using the side of your hand to tighten the surface as you go. If you’re feeling wobbly, don’t fret! There are also so many great YouTube videos that demonstrate how to do this. Just search “shaping sourdough”. Once you’ve shaped your loaf, use a bench scraper to carefully flip the dough, seam-side up into the prepared proofing basket or towel-lined colander. Sprinkle the top with flour and cover with a tea towel or by folding the corners of the towel that lines your colander over the dough. TO BAKE THE LOAF THE NEXT DAY: Let the loaf sit at room temperature for 30-40 minutes and then move it to the refrigerator for 12 - 24 hours. TO BAKE THE LOAF RIGHT AWAY: If baking today let your loaf rise for about 2-3 hours, until the dough has doubled in size. BAKE YOUR SOURDOUGH BREAD: Preheat oven to 475°F. Some say to preheat your Dutch oven in the oven. We’ve tried it both ways and find that there really is no difference. Arrange a parchment paper square on a flat surface. Carefully transfer the dough, seam side down, onto the parchment. Using a lame, sharp knife or razor, quickly give your loaf a good slash across the top. Immediately lift the parchment corners and set the loaf in the Dutch oven. Cover, and place in the oven. NOTE: If you wait too long to put your dough in the oven after slashing, it will lose air and you won’t be happy with the results. Bake for 25 minutes, covered. After 25 minutes, remove the lid and bake, uncovered, for another 25 or 30 depending on how dark you want your loaf. Once done, remove the bread from the Dutch oven and allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting. Don’t rush this process or you won’t be happy with your results!NOTE: Loaves straight from the fridge are easiest to work with. If baking more than one loaf, keep the other loaves in the refrigerator until ready to use. "

","Find a pot large enough to fit six eggs comfortably. Place a folded dish cloth in the bottom of the pot to protect the eggs from hitting the bottom while boiling. Fill the pot with cold water and place over high heat. Once the water starts to boil, use a slotted spoon to lower all six eggs at once into the water. Set a timer for 13 mins. While eggs are boiling, prepare an ice bath for the eggs by filling a medium-sized bowl with ice water. As soon as the timer goes off, kill the heat and carefully remove the eggs from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and place them immediately into the ice water. Leave the hard-boiled eggs submerged in the ice water for five minutes. Carefully peel the eggs by gently cracking the entire egg shell. Use the side of your thumb to gently push away the cracked shell is the best way we’ve found to keep the white part of the hard-boiled egg nice and smooth. Note: The older the egg, the easier it will be to peel, so if your farm-fresh eggs are hard to peel, remember it’s not you. It’s them. "
687,How to Make Sourdough Starter,"
                A sourdough starter's purpose is to make your bread rise. Time encourages the growth of wild yeasts in a simple mixture of flour and water making a naturally-created leavener for bread baking.
            ",10,0,1,,432,2 g,0 mg,7 mg,91 g,14 g,0 g,8 g,"1 cupflour (whole wheat or all-purpose)
1/2 cupwater
1 cupall-purpose or whole wheat flour
1/2 cupwater
","TO MAKE YOUR SOURDOUGH STARTER: Combine the flour and water in a container with at least a 1-quart capacity. Glass containers are best, but stainless steel, or ceramic containers are also fine.Stir the flour and water together to make a sticky paste. Make sure that there is no dry flour. Then scrape down the sides and cover the container lightly with a tea towel or plastic wrap and set it somewhere warm (aiming for about 70°F) for 24 hours. The top of the fridge is usually a good spot. After 24 hours, it's time to feed the starter again. Don't worry if you don't see any bubbling yet (although you may). Measure out 1/2 cup of the flour and water mixture, and discard the rest. Add a scant 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup of cool-but-not-cold water to the starter, and mix thoroughly to make a sticky paste. Cover the bowl, and set it back in its warm spot for another 24 hours. After 24 hours has passed, it's time to feed the starter again. By now—day 3—you should see some bubbling, and the starter will likely smell fruity and yeasty. To feed the starter, take the cover off the container and give the starter a good stir. Then measure out 1/2 cup of starter—this is what you'll keep—and discard the rest. Return that 1/2 cup of starter to the bowl, and feed it with a scant cup of flour and 1/2 cup of water. Stir vigorously to combine, cover and store for 12 hours. At this point, it's time to begin to feed the starter more frequently, about every 12 hours (or as close to that as you're reasonably able to do—no need to set an alarm). Every 12 hours, scoop out a slightly-heaped 1/2 cup of starter and discard the rest. Then feed the starter with 1 scant cup of flour and 1/2 cup of cool water, stir and store. Repeat this process every 12 hours until your starter is ready. Your starter is ready when it is very, very bubbly, and doubles in size within 6-8 hours of a feeding. This can take anywhere from 7 days to two weeks. TO STORE AND MAINTAIN YOUR STARTER: Transfer a generous 1/2 (4 ounces) of starter to its permanent home—a crock, large mason jar, or whatever you'd like to store it in long-term. Feed it with 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup water, and let it rest at room temperature for several hours. If you're storing starter in a jar with a screw-top, screw the top on very loosely to store.After a few hours, move the starter to the refrigerator, and feed it regularly, at least once a week. To use, bring starter to room temperature and feed. Once it doubles in size, it's ready to use.If you decide to store it at room temperature, you'll need to feed your starter everyday. *Inspiration and knowledge for creating a sourdough starter came from King Arthur Flour."

salt

1/4 cupflat leaf parsley
","Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 12” skillet over medium high heat. Sauté the peppers and onion, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, and sauté for 2 minutes longer. Add cumin, paprika and tomato paste stir until incorporated. Add 2 cans of Muir Glen Organic Diced Tomatoes, and their liquid to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 25-30 minutes. Season with salt and sugar.Start up the grill. On a lightly floured surface, roll out pizza dough to ½ inch thickness. Take care that it is stretched out evenly, to prevent any weak spots in your crust. Brush one side of dough with 1 tablespoon of remaining olive oil. Turn heat to medium-high and oil the grill grate. Using a rolling pin, carefully drape the dough on to the grate oiled side down. Grill until slightly puffed and grill marks appear on the underside of the dough, about 3 minutes.Using a large metal spatula, loosen and flip dough over onto a lightly floured cookie sheet, so that the grill marks are facing up. Spread the shaksukah tomato sauce over the grilled side of the pizza leaving a 1 inch border. Sprinkle mozzarella evenly over the sauce. Create 4 (4-inch) wells in the cheese and sauce, you want the wells deep enough that the raw eggs don’t spill out of them, but not so deep that the eggs don’t cook evenly or quickly.Carefully crack 1 egg into each of the wells. Season with salt and pepper.Oil the grate with remaining oil and carefully slide the pizza back onto the grill. Close the grill and cook over medium heat until the underside of the crust is browned and the egg whites are firm, about 5 minutes. If the eggs are too runny for your liking, you can finish the pizza off in the oven at 350° until desired doneness. Transfer pizza to a cutting board and sprinkle with feta cheese and parsley."

","In a large pot of boil water, cook cauliflower florets until soft enough to smash with a fork. About 12 minutes. Drain well and allow to cool. Using a nut bag, ring all liquid out cauliflower. Should yield about 1.5 cups of liquid. The more liquid you can get out of the cauliflower, the crispier your crust will be. Preheat oven to 425°F. In a large bowl combine prepared cauliflower, cream cheese, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and oregano. Using a fork break up the cauliflower and mix together with spices, eggs and cheese until fully combine.

Remove from oven and set a new piece of parchment over the top of the pizza. Using your hands carefully flip the pizza crust so the top is now face down. At this point you can remove all parchment if you want as it will no longer stick to anything. Cook for an additional 15 minutes, or until edges are golden and crispy. Remove finished pizza crust from oven and top with toppings of your choice. For this pizza we spread tomato pesto and topped with mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and olives.

Allow pies to cool slightly on the baking sheet and then cool completely on a cooling rack. Notes:See above for freezing and refrigeration instructions.Pizza, these work wonderfully as a pizza crust. For personal pizza divide the dough into 6 balls rather than 12 which makes two Keto crust servings per personal pizza, or make two whole 10/12 inch crusts which would equal 6 servings per pizza.

Serve warm over mashed potatoes or egg noodles, alongside steamed veggies and lingonberry jam. Cooking Notes:*Gluten Free Version: if you want to keep this recipe gluten free, you can sub the breadcrumbs for a gluten-free version. To keep the gluten out of the gravy, you will want to reserve 1 cup of beef stock and mix it with ⅓ cup corn starch. Add it to the gravy at the end to thicken it up. ** I like to shape the meatballs and place them on a piece of parchment paper for easy clean up and less dishes. Then I use another piece of parchment to place the browned meatballs on, again, easy clean up, less dishes. *** If you take your time adding the beef broth, your gravy will stay thick, taking less time overall. **** Take care not to boil the cream. It might separate if you do. Keep it at a simmer until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. ***** The meatballs should reach an internal temperature of 165° F and no longer be pink on the inside. "

","Place the beans in a large pot. Fill the pot of beans with water, double the beans volume. Bring to a boil. Boil the beans for 45 minutes making sure the beans are always covered in water. The beans should be tender with a little bite left in them.While the beans are boiling, sauté celery, onion and bell pepper in 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pan. When onions begin to soften add the garlic. Sauté until onions are translucent about 10 minutes. Set aside.After the beans are done boiling, drain them and place the ham hock into the bottom of the pot. Add the onion-garlic mixture to the pot along with the beans. Add the salt, pepper, thyme, bay leaves, Worcestershire sauce, parsley and Creole seasoning. Add just enough water to cover everything in the pot. Bring to a boil them simmer for 2-3 hours. During this time the beans will release starch which will turn the water and seasoning into a rich gravy. How “wet” the sauce is depends on your liking. If it gets too sticky, add water ¼ cup at a time.While the red beans are melding with the deliciousness and making the sauce, add the last tablespoon of olive oil to the pan that was used for veggies. Sauté ham and sausage until slightly brown on all edges. During the last hour of simmering add it all to the pot of beans.Serve over white rice along side pickled okra, Louisiana hot sauce and of course good corn bread.Notes: * Browning ham and sausage until crispy is completely optional if you're pressed for time. You'll still get great flavor, but we love the extra step as it crisps up the meat a little bit giving it a delicious texture! * If you have a leftover ham bone from the holidays, use it in place of the ham hock! Much better than split pea soup. "

","Make the dough: In a large saucepan set over medium, heat the milk, vegetable oil, and sugar until it reaches 100-110°F without letting the mixture boil. Turn off the heat. When the milk mixture is 100-110°F, sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit until beginning to foam a little, about 2 minutes. If you have a stand mixer, you can transfer the warm milk to its bowl and continue with the steps below. Alternatively you can keep the milk mixture in the saucepan, add the flour and mix the dough by hand. Add 4 cups of flour to the milk and yeast and mix until combined. Cover the pot or bowl with a clean kitchen towel, and set aside in a warm place (not near a window) for an hour. Remove the towel and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt and remaining ½ cup of flour. Stir to combine. You can use the dough right away, or place it in a mixing bowl covered and refrigerate it for up to 3 days, punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl.Remove the dough from the saucepan or stand mixer bowl onto a lightly floured surface, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 30x10-inches. Using a pastry knife or the tips of your fingers, spread 1 cup of the softened Earth Balance evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving 1-inch of space on one of the long sides. Sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar over the butter. Beginning at the long end with butter spread all the way to the edge, roll the rectangle tightly toward the long side with the 1-inch unbuttered border. Use both hands and work slowly, being careful to keep the roll tight. Don’t worry if the filling oozes out a little as you work. When you reach the end, pinch the 1-inch unbuttered dough together with the dough roll to create a seal. On a cutting board, using a sharp knife, make 1 ½-inch slices, about 20-25 rolls. Pour or spread 2 tablespoons of melted butter into your desired pie pans or baking dishes and swirl to coat completely. Place the sliced rolls in the pans, keeping about an inch between each roll. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cover the baking dishes or pie pans with a thin kitchen towel and set aside to rise on the countertop for at least 20 minutes before baking. Remove the towel and bake in the preheated oven for 13 to 17 minutes, until golden brown.Make the maple frosting: In a large bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla soy milk, melted Earth Balance, coffee, salt and maple flavoring. Whisk until very smooth. Adjust ingredients to taste, more maple flavoring, sugar, butter or milk as needed until the icing reaches the desired consistency. The icing should be pourable. After the rolls are finished baking, drizzle the icing over the top and spread evenly. Wait a few minutes for the frosting to sink into the warm cinnamon rolls before serving. *Adapted from The Pioneer Woman"

Place the sliced rolls in the pans, being careful not to over crowd.Preheat the oven to 375°F.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk and almond extract until smooth. The icing should be thick but still pourable. If it is too thin add more sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. If it is too thick, add more milk ¼ teaspoon at a time.After the rolls are finished baking, and still warm, generously drizzle icing over the top. Be sure to get it all around the edges and over the top. As they sit, the rolls will absorb some of the icing’s moisture and flavor. These are best served warm, but they are just as delicious if made a day ahead.The dough for this recipe was adapted from from The Pioneer Woman."
